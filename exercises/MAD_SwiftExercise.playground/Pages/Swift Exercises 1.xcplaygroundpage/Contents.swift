//: If you need help or have any questions, please feel free to contact me. You can find my contact info on the [course website](https://avf.github.io/mobile-app-dev/). I'm always happy to help!
//:
//: ## How to do the exercises
//: - Follow the instructions for the exercises.
//: - Please write any code that I ask for right into the playground.
//: - Any time I ask a question in an exercise, **please add a comment with the explanation in your own words.**
//:
//: Here's an example:
//:
//: Write a Hello World program in Swift in a single line. Why is this a valid Swift program?

print("Hello, World!") // This works because Swift programs by default execute statements in the global scope. A `main` function or similar is not required.

//: ## Exercises
//: ### Variables and Constants
//: 1. Declare a variable with value `42` that is implicitly assigned type `Int`.
//: 1. Declare a constant with value `42` that is implicitly assigned type `Int`.
//: 1. Declare a variable with value `42.5`. What type does it have?
//: 1. Declare a variable with explicit type `Float` and value `42.5`.
//: 1. Declare an uninitialized constant with type `String`. Will you ever be able to assign a value to this constant?

//: ### Strings and String interpolation
//: 1. Create a constant of type `String` containing the text `"This is a String."`.
//: 1. Create a mutable String with `"This is an Int: "` as its initial value.
//: 1. Create an `Int` constant with value 42 and append it to the mutable string, resulting in the value: `"This is an Int: 42"`.
//: 1. Create another constant containing the same string, but this time use a string literal and string interpolation (the `\()` syntax) to create it.
//: 1. Create a multiline string using the multiline string literal.

//: ### Arrays and Dictionaries
//: Arrays
//: 1. Create an immutable array and initialize it with an array literal containing 3 `String` elements
//: 1. Create an empty mutable array of type `[String]`
//: 1. Append the second element of the first (immutable) array to the second (mutable) array.
//: 1. Can you modify one of the `String` elements in the first array (for example, append a word to it)? Why/why not? What if the elements were not of type `String`, but instead of a class?
//: 1. What happens if you modify the `String` element in the second array (for example, if you append a word to it)? Will the second element in the first array also change, or stay the same? Explain why.
//: 1. Create an immutable empty array of type `[Int]` without any literals, using the name of the class (`Array`) and the standard initializer for generic types (`var value = ClassName<GenericType>()`)

//: Dictionaries
//: 1. Create a mutable empty Dictionary of type `[String: Double]`
//: 1. Set the value for the key `"Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything"` to `42`.

//: ### Optionals
//: 1. Create an optional `String` variable
//: 1. Print the String on the console. Make sure the variable is first unwrapped and only the actual value is printed. You may either force-unwrap the string or use an `if let` construct.
//: 1. What happens if you force-unwrap an optional variable that contains `nil`?
//: 1. Create another optional `String` variable and asign the value `nil`. Use the nil coalescing operator (`??`) to print the first unwrapped String from above.
//: 1. Do the same thing again, but this time use the ternary conditional operator `(a ? b : c)`.

//: Optional chaining
//: 1. Consider the following `struct`. Use optional chaining to change the value of `anOptionalInt` in `instance` to a new value of your choice in a single line of code. What would happen if we executed that line while `instance` is `nil`?
//: 1. Use the `if let` conditional and optional chaining to print the value of `anOptionalInt` in `instance`. What would happen if `instance` or `anOptionalInt` were `nil`?
//: 1. Use optional chaining to call the method `sayHelloWorld` of `instance`. What would happen if `instance` were `nil`?

struct MyStruct {
    var anOptionalInt: Int? = 5
    
    func sayHelloWorld() {
        print("Hello, World!")
    }
}

var instance: MyStruct? = MyStruct()

//: ### Control flow
//: 1. Write a `for-in` loop that sums up all the values in `myNumbers`.
//: 1. Create an empty mutable `[Int: Int]` dictionary. Use a `for-in` loop to iterate over the elements in `myNumbers` and add each value to the dictionary, using the index of each element in `myNumbers` as its key. So for example, the dictionary should contain the key/value pair `0:12`, because 12 is element 0 of `myNumbers`.

let myNumbers = [12, 23, 1, 104]

//: ### Functions and Closures
//: Functions
//: 1. Declare and call a function without any parameters or return type that prints Hello World.
//: 1. Declare and call a function that takes two strings as parameters and returns a string.
//: 1. Declare and call a function with the same signature (two strings as parameters and returns a string), but this time remove the first argument label.
//: 1. Declare and call a function with the same signature (two strings as parameters and returns a string), but this time make the first argument label **different** from the parameter name (=use a custom argument label).
//: 1. Declare a function with an default parameter value. Call the function twice, once with the argument present, once without.
//: 1. Declare a function with name `callAFunction` that takes another function as parameter and then executes it. Call your newly declared `callAFunction` and pass in one of the functions you previously declared.

//: Closures
//: 1. Create an optional variable that holds a closure (with a `String` parameter and no return type) and assign `nil`.
//: 1. Call the closure using optional chaining. What will happen?
//: 1. Create a `typealias` for this type of closure.

//: 1. Take a look at the following function, which takes a closure as parameter and calls it. This function is then called. For each of the following exercises, call the function again, but each time use one more simplification:
//:   * Omit closure parameter types.
//:   * Omit the closure return type
//:   * Omit the round brackets and argument label (we can do that since it's the last function parameter)
//:   * Omit the closure parameters completely. In the closure body, use the shorthand argument names (for example `$0`)
//:   * Omit the keyword `return`

func callAClosure(closure: (String, String) -> String) {
    print(closure("Hello", "World"))
}
callAClosure(closure: { (item1: String, item2: String) -> String in
    return "\(item1) \(item2)"
})


//: ### Classes
//: 1. Create a new class named `Person`. Add non-optional `firstName` and `lastName` properties and an initializer.
//: 1. Add a `name` computed property that returns a `String` containing the first and last name.
//: 1. Add a method named `greet` that returns the following `String`: `"Hi, I'm \(name)."`
//: 1. Create a subclass of `Person` and name it `Student`.
//: 1. Add a `Float?` optional property called `grade`. Use property observers to make sure that the grade is not lower than 1.0 and not higher than 5.0 when it gets set. Clamp the new value to this interval.
//: 1. Override the `greet` function from the superclass. If the `grade` property is set, it should now return `"Hi, I'm \(name). My grade is: \(grade)"`. If the `grade property isn't set, return the superclass's implementation.

//: ### Enums and Structs
//: 1. Create an enum named `PetType` with cases `dog` and `cat`
//: 1. In your new enum, create a function or computed property named `animalSound` that returns a `String`. Use a `switch` statement on `self` to differentiate between the cases and return `"woof"` for the `.dog` case and `"meow"` for the `.cat` case.
//: 1. Create a structure named `Pet`, with a `name` property of type `String` and a `type` constant of type `PetType` (both non-optional).
//: 1. Add a function to your structure named `makeNoise` that returns a `String`. In its implementation, return the `animalSound` of its `type`.
//: 1. Create 3 or more instances of your `Pet` struct and store them in `let` constants. Then create a new array that contains all your pets and store it in a variable.
//: 1. Change one of the names of the pets in your array. Does this change the name of any of the pets stored in the `let` constants? Explain why/why not.
//: 1. Can you change the name of one of the pets stored in the `let` constants? Explain why/why not.
//: 1. Create 3 or more instances of your `Student` class from above and store them in `let` constants. Then create a new array that contains all your students and store it in a variable.
//: 1. Change one of the names of the students in your array. Does this change the name of any of the students stored in the `let` constants? Explain why/why not.
//: 1. Can you change the name of one of the students stored in the `let` constants? Explain why/why not.

//: ### Protocols and extensions
//: 1. Create a protocol called `NamedThing`. Add a `get` variable of type `String`, with the name `name`.
//: 1. Use extensions to make your `Person` class and `Pet` structs from above conform to the new protocol.
//: 1. Create a new array that contains all the objects you declared as `let` constants above. You may have to explicitly specify the type of the array as `[NamedThing]`.
//: 1. Iterate over the objects in the array and print out their names.
//: 1. Create a protocol extension for `NamedThing` that contains a new computed property of type `String` called `initial`. Add a default implementation in your protocol extension, which returns the first character of the `name` property, or, if `name` is empty, an empty string.
//: 1. Print the new `initials` property in the loop you created above.
