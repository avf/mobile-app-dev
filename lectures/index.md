### Stanford Course

Some of the lectures will be loosely based on the Stanford course CS193P from the fall 2018 semester. The videos for this course are on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPA-ayBrweUzGFmkT_W65z64MoGnKRZMq), and the [lecture slides, exercises and code are also available](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-TWZDChwwzkiGzt78QlPZDzN-j82JfR6).
